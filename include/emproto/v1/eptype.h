/*    MESSAGE TYPE
 *
 * This type is directly present into the master header and provides the first
 * differentiation of the possible type of message. This types provides
 * information on how to treat the type of action carried, so if it's a single
 * event, a scheduled or a trigger one.
 *
 *    ACTION TYPE
 * After the first classification, you find the type of action performed; this
 * is unique among all the possible types, and defines what request to perform
 * or which response is reported back.
